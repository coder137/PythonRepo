# Working

xkcdDownloader downloads images from [the xkcd site](https://xkcd.com) from the first page all the way upto the last page (1st comic).
Images are saved as 'img_num'.'img_name' in the Comic Folder

An additional check feature is added so that no file is downloaded twice.
If the file exists insde the Comic Directory that image is not downloaded from the xkcd site again.
Thereby maximizing efficiency

**If any file is accidentaly deleted just run the script, it will automatically find the file that isn't present and download it**
